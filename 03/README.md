### Assignment 03

We're now done with the whole `Kubernetes`/`Go` oriented part of that test. Let's talk infrastructure. You are now asked to come up with 3 different yet simple diagrams to describe multiple kind of architectures:
* A private cluster, whom nodes run in a private network but can still access the internet
* A public cluster, whom nodes are directly connected to the internet
* An air gapped cluster, whom nodes are strongly isolated from any external network

All of them should be evenly distributed across 3 zones of a given region.

Please describe as a diagram for each of them the architecture of their VPC(s), subnet(s), route table(s), NAT(s) and load balancer(s). You might use any cloud provider's or standard networking naming. We strongly advice you to use a tool such as [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

Congrats, you made it through and are now done with the test !
