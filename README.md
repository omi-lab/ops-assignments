## Ops Assignments

This repository contains the different assignments we would like you to complete. There are 4 of them.

### Assignments

#### 00

The first assignment is pure `Go`. The goal is to prove your good understanding of how networking things work in `Go`. You will be asked to run things inside `Kubernetes` but that's definitely not the goal of that exercice.

#### 01

The second assignment is more `Kubernetes` oriented and will help us understand how familiar you are with its standard resources.

#### 02

The third assignment focuses on `Docker`, and basics of running container securely, with a little bit of `Kubernetes`.

#### 03

Eventually, the fourth assignment will only focus on your overall infrastructure skills.

### How should I proceed

Each assignment defines its own `README.md` file that should contain everything you need to get stated. Fork the repo, then open a pull request once you're done with all the assignments.

Good luck !
