#### Assignment

You're now asked to slightly improve the security of your deployment. Your container is currently running as the root user. There are two approaches that are *not* mutually exclusive and you can both implement side by side:
* Create and enforce an user in your `Dockerfile`
* Enforce the user in your app deployment
* Any other security improvements are of course welcome

You can then move on to the next assignment.
